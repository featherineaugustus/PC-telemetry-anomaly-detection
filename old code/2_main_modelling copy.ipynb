    "\n",
    "We used the smart manufacturing iot cloud monitoring dataset as such machines are similar to a PC. It contains features such as temperature, vibration, humidity, pressure, and energy consumption, which can represent the real features of a PC in several ways:\n",
    "- Temperature: \n",
    "    - Represents the thermal state of PC components like CPU and GPU. \n",
    "    - Elevated, fluctuating, or sustained high temps often hint at cooling interface degradation or increased workload—just as in IoT systems, abnormal temperature readings indicate equipment stress or failure \n",
    "\n",
    "- Vibration: \n",
    "    - In PCs, fan vibration or hard-drive spin irregularities act like mechanical failure indicators—mirroring industrial settings where vibration spikes reveal mechanical faults in motors or structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Humidity: \n",
    "    - While PCs are kept in controlled environments, ambient humidity still affects internal corrosion risk and electrical stability—just like environmental IoT sensor systems highlight humidity’s impact on electronic device reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pressure: \n",
    "    - Though PCs don’t have internal pressure sensors, this can stand in for PSU voltage fluctuations or airflow pressure changes. \n",
    "    - In industrial IoT, pressure sensors track fluid or airflow—changes often signal blockages or system degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Energy consumption: \n",
    "    - Maps directly to PC power draw, reflecting CPU/GPU workloads or inefficiencies—exist in IoT energy‐monitoring systems where spikes can signal abnormal component behavior .\n"
